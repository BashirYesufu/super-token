# Super Tokens

## Getting Started
This repository contain the code for the Super tokens test App. This project was written using the Flutter 3.0.0 SDK and Dart programming Language. If you're new to Flutter and Dart, Check out the SDK at https://www.flutter.dev and the language at https://dart.dev/.

## How to Use

**Step 1:**


You must have Flutter 3.0.0 and Dart Installed to build this project. Check the links above if you haven't done so. You might experience build issues running on a lower flutter version. If you don't have flutter 3.0.0, You can you fvm to download it and manage your flutter version locally. I have included a link to it.

**Step 2:**

Go to project root and execute the following command in terminal to get the required dependencies:

```
flutter pub get 
```

**Step 3:**

Run your simulator for iOS or android emulator and smash the build button. Easy right? Leggo!

## Conclusion
The Supertokens integration requires NodeJS, Django or GoLang experience which I currently do not possess as I am focused on frontend mobile technologies at this time. I have included replaceable constants in the api constant file if you have the urls set up and would like to test..
I have also used mock data to display how the login and account creation would happen without serverside integration.
